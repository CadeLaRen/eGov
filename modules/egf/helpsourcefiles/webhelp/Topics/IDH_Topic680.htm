      <p><span class="ts19">Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) are involved in a lot of financial transactions as part of their day-to-day functioning. They receive income from various sources such as tax, license fee and fines, along with other sources such as grants from the state and central governments. For example, a ULB can receive a fund from a state government to provide relief funds to farmers who lost their crops in a natural calamity. </span></p>
      <p class="ps3"><span class="ts19">ULBs can also raise funds by obtaining loans from various public sector banks and financial institutions to meet their immediate financial requirements.</span></p>
      <p class="ps3"><span class="ts19">ULBs disburse funds in a diverse manner such as making payments to contractors and suppliers who work closely with ULBs, in addition to the payment that is made to the employees.</span></p>
      <p class="ps3"><span class="ts19">ULBs also have assets in the form of bank deposits, machineries, vehicles, buildings, and accounts receivables.</span></p>
      <p class="ps3"><span class="ts19">The accounts department has to maintain every financial event, clearly demonstrating the way it was originally transpired, as these events are subject to auditing to ensure that the accounts are conforming to the prevalent accounting practices and to check any irregularities in the utilization of the fund. Such events are also open to public to help them know how the public fund is utilized and to thereby maintain transparency in the functioning of the ULB.</span></p>
      <p class="ps3"><span class="ts19">Manually maintaining all financial transactions in a ULB is nearly impossible.</span></p>
      <p class="ps3"><span class="ts19">eGov Financials is an application which automates the end-to-end financial operations of a ULB by providing an integrated system that manages budgeting, asset management, in addition to the daily accounting and reporting. This system is specifically built for Municipal Accounting and its particular needs based on the National Municipal Account Manual (NMAM) published by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) and Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India.</span></p>
