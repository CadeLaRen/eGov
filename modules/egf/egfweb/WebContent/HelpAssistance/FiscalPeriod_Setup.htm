Closing Balance:&nbsp; </span>

<!-- Objective Section Stats -->
<span class="hbold0">
Objective: </span> Period closing is an activity that must be performed to ‘close’ a period or a financial year.
<p>The following operations must be allowed:
</p>
<p>Close a Financial Year and Transfer Closing Balance for a specific Financial Year: This does not allow any postings for that Year (update the Active for Posting Flag to 0) and computes the closing balances as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Income/Expenditure Accounts:
For each income  account (Type=1), the net balance is computed as follows:
Closing balance = Opening credit balance + Sum of credit transactions – (Sum of debit transactions + Opening debit balance)
</p>
<p>For each expenditure account (Type=2), the net balance is computed as follows:
Closing balance = Opening debit balance + Sum of debit transactions – (sum of credit transactions + Opening credit balance)
</p>
<p>The net balance (excess of income over expenditure) is computed once the above is done:
</p>
<p>If the balance is greater than zero, the amount is added to the CREDIT BALANCE of the liability account that is assigned a purpose code of 7 (‘ExcessIE’)
If the balance is less than zero, the amount is added to the DEBIT BALANCE of the liability account that is assigned a purpose code of 7 (‘ExcessIE’).
Only one liability detailed account code MUST be designated with purpose code of 7. The net balance is updated as the opening balance of the NEXT FINANCIAL YEAR for that liability account code.
</p>
<p>Asset/Liability accounts:
For each liability account (Type=3), the net balance is computed as follows:
Closing balance = Opening credit balance + Sum of credit transactions – (Sum of debit transactions + Opening debit balance)
</p>
<p>For each asset account (Type=4), the net balance is computed as follows:
Closing balance = Opening debit balance + Sum of debit transactions – (sum of credit transactions + Opening credit balance)
For each asset/liability account, the net balance is updated as the opening balance of the NEXT FINANCIAL YEAR for that account code.

closed earlier so that vouchers can be posted within that date range. However, 
the Financial Year status will override this condition. In other words, if the 
Financial Year has a status of Active For Posting =0, then re-opening of a date 
range will NOT allow any vouchers to be posted for that date range.</span></p>
