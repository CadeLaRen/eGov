Objective: </span>
<p>This screen is used to map account codes to specific screens or fields (services). The account codes that are mapped to a particular screen/field will appear as drop-down lists in those screens or fields, from which the user can select the account code he wants. The Code-Screen mapping set-up has a field “service which lists out a number of screen names or field names. On selection of a service and mapping the relevant account codes to this service through the Code-Screen mapping, the mapped account codes appear as drop-down lists in the screen/field to which they are mapped.
