Objective: </span>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Recovery types that are created will be mapped to the above Work/Contract types and Party types. Hence any Invoice that is made for that work type WO and Party type will list only those Recovery types that are mapped to the work type and Party type. 
Every deduction/Recovery in the invoice should be made using the “Recovery type” that is defined in the master. Any deduction that is entered without the deduction type in the Invoice cannot be remitted using remittance module.
