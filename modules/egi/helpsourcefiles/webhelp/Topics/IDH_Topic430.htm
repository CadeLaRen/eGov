      <p><span class="ts8">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p><span class="ts17"># 3 - 30 MHz. High Frequency (HF). This is also known as the Short Wave band. It includes the CB band (see below) and the channels used for radio control. As the frequency of the carrier wave increases, it becomes possible to encode more information and to crowd channels (proportionately) closer together.</span></p>
      <p><span class="ts17"># 30 - 300 MHz. Very High Frequency (VHF). (includes FM radio and television). Antennae are often made to be about one quarter or one half wavelength long.</span></p>
      <p><span class="ts17"># 300 MHz - 3 GHz. Ultra High Frequency (VHF). (GHz = 109 Hz). This includes some television and mobile phones: see below. Many channels are available.</span></p>
      <p><span class="ts17"># 3 - 30 GHz. Super High Frequency (SHF). (roughly corresponds to microwave band) Used for communication with satellites.</span></p>
      <p><span class="ts17"># 30 - 300 GHz. Extra High Frequency (EHF). Not much used for radio communication (yet), because of the technological difficulty of encoding and decoding amplitude and frequency modulation at such high frequencies. </span></p>

      <p><span class="ts18">The administrator must be able to define a hierarchy of boundary types. In a ULB, some cities (e.g. Delhi, Bangalore) have the following hierarchy: City -&gt;Zone-&gt; Ward-&gt;Block-&gt;Street etc while the smaller ULBs have City -&gt; Ward as the boundary type. </span></p>
      <p><span class="ts18">Once the hierarchy of boundary types is defined, the administrator user must be able to define values for each boundary type. Except for the root node (ie the top-level boundary node), the user must have the ability to define multiple values at all levels in the hierarchy. The system should support the &lsquo;</span><span class="ts29">from and to date</span><span class="ts18">&rsquo; for each of the boundary values.</span></p>
      <p><span class="ts20">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p><span class="ts30">Hierarchy type</span><span class="ts31">: The ULB can have multiple hierarchy types. Administrative, Birth and Death, Health etc</span></p>

      <p><span class="ts31">Every City can have a multiple hierarchy types. Hierarchy set up is used to set up these hierarchy types. The hierarchy types can be different for different cities and different applications. </span></p>
      <p class="ps44"><span class="ts31">Eg: Revenue and Birth and Death have different hierarchy types</span></p>
      <p class="ps44"><span class="ts32">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="ps44"><span class="ts31">For example in the following figure the city of Bangalore has 2 hierarchy types Admin and Birth and Death. The admin hierarchy type has the following Boundary types with the parent child relationship. City</span><span class="ts33">&#61664;</span><span class="ts31">Zone</span><span class="ts33">&#61664;</span><span class="ts31">Ward</span><span class="ts33">&#61664;</span><span class="ts31">Block. Bangalore is the city having Zone 1 and Zone 2 as its children. Wards Ward 1 and Ward 2 are the children of Zone Zone 1 and so on.</span></p>
      <p class="ps44">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="ps44"><span class="ts31">Birth and Death Hierarchy type has city and regsistration unit as the boundary types.</span></p>

      <p><span class="ts34">Boundary Type for Hierarchy </span></p>
      <p class="ps45"><span class="ts31">In each of the Hierarchy types, we can set up a hierarchy of Boundary types. For example Admin Boundary Can be </span><br /><span class="ts31">City </span><span class="ts33">&#61664;</span><span class="ts31">&nbsp;1</span></p>

      <p class="ps44"><span class="ts31">Where a city has multiple Zones and each zone has one or more wards.</span></p>
      <p><span class="ts31">Hierarchy would be automatically calculated as the next number based on the parent of this Boundary type. For Root Boundary types, the hierarchy would be 1</span></p>

      <p class="ps44"><span class="ts31">Works are carried out in a specific or multiple Boundaries. Users are assigned to specific Boundaries.</span></p>
      <p class="ps44"><span class="ts31">New Boundaries might be created. Old Boundaries might be deactivated. The system should allow for this along with the dates of activation and deactivation.</span></p>

      <p class="ps44"><span class="ts31">Each Application in the eGov Suite is called a Module. Each of these modules can be subdivided into sub-modules and the Sub-modules will have a number of features. </span></p>

There should be an entry in the Action table for each and every JSP/HTML/Action class in the System. Each Action is Uniquely identified by it&rsquo;s name. Action will always have a URL by which we can access it which can be broken into 3 components</span></p>

      <p class="ps44"><span class="ts31">Access to the action will be controlled on Base URL and the Query Params. Multiple Actions can have the Same Base URL but the Base URL and Query Params combination must be unique.</span></p>
      <p class="ps44"><span class="ts31">Base URL and Query Params will be used along with Role Action mapping to allow/disallow access to a given action for a given user.</span></p>

      <p><span class="ts31">A Role can be given access to certain modules/actions in the system. The creation of modules/actions has been explained in the previous sections. The mapping will be used to allow access to features in the system based on the role of the logged in user. </span></p>
      <p><span class="ts31">The role can be allowed an access to an entire module in which case he will have access to all the actions under that role. Alternatively he can be allowed access to individual actions with in a given module.</span></p>
      <p><span class="ts32">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p><span class="ts31">The user can have multiple roles. In this case, if any role allows access to the action, the RBAC shall allow the access to the user. </span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="ts31">The screen will be used to both view as well as editing the role to action mapping.</span></p>

      <p><span class="ts31">The user in the application can be created using this application (which will capture the bare minimum details) or the users can be created by individual applications by using the API&rsquo;s provided by the User Module. Eg: PIMS module can create Employee as a user, Property Tax application can create citizen as a user and EGF can create Supplier as a user in the system. These modules will normally add more details as required by their respective modules and would be stored in the application scope.</span></p>

      <p><span class="ts31">Based on the user&rsquo;s primary work, s/he normally goes through the same set of links every time and it is troublesome for him/her to go through the complete hierarchy of the menu tree. There should be a facility for him to save the list of repetitive actions as favorites and these should appear at the top just below the root menu.</span></p>
