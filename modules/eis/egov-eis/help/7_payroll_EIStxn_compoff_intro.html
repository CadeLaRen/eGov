<h3>Compensatory Off Leave</h3>

<p>Compensatory Off (or CompOff) leave is awarded to employees who
have worked on holidays. </p>

<p>All the holidays of the organisation are indicated in the
Attendance Register. They are identified by the letter H in the
column below the date of the holiday. An employee who worked on a
holiday is eligible to avail leave on a regular working day in lieu
of the holiday worked.</p>

<p>Employee attendance on a holiday needs to be recorded in the
Attendance Register by marking the employee present on a specific
holiday. </p>
