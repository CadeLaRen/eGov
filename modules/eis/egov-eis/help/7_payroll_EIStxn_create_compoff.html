<h3>Create Compensatory Off</h3>

<p>To create a Compensatory Off leave, it is necessary that the date
of the holiday that the employee worked is recorded in the Attendance
Register. The employee should also be eligible for this type of
leave. The leave types for which an employee is eligible are created
in the Leave Master.</p>

<p><strong>Record date of Holiday Worked</strong></p>

<p>1. In the eGov EIS Payroll home page, click EIS-Payroll.</p>

<p>2. Click EIS.</p>

<p>3. Under EIS, click Attendance and then click Create. </p>

<p>4. Make sure that you specify the month for which you want to mark
the compensatory off. </p>

<p>5. Search for the employee for whom a compensatory off needs to be
marked.</p>

<p>6. On the date of the holiday when the employee worked, mark the
letter P. </p>

<p>7. Click <strong>Save.</strong> You now see a pop-up with the
message: <em>Provide a CompOff? </em></p>

<p>8. You can now:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Click <strong>OK</strong> to indicate
    that a compensatory off needs to be provided. 
    <p>Or </p>
  </li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Click <strong>Cancel</strong> if no
    compensatory off should be given. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you click <strong>OK</strong> the
employee's leave credit for the leave type Compensatory Off is
incremented by 1. This is important as such credit to the available
leave of type CompOff is required when it becomes necessary to
approve the CompOff holiday that the employee applies for. </p>

<p><strong>Approve CompOff Leave</strong></p>

<p>An employee needs to avail of a CompOff holiday within 3 months of
the date of the holiday that was worked. A CompOff holiday can only
be given to an employee if they are eligible for this type of leave
(configured in the Leave Master) and they have available leave
credit.</p>

<p>To approve a CompOff, you must have the necessary hierarchy
privileges.</p>

<p>1. In the EIS menu, select Leave Application to view different
leave application options.</p>

<p>2. Click Approve Compensatory Off. This opens the Search CompOff
to Approve screen.</p>

<p>3. Enter the Employee code if known, or other search criteria and
click <strong>Submit.</strong></p>

<p>4. From the Search Results, click the employee for whom the
Compensatory Off holiday is to be approved. This shows the
following:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">CompOff Date</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Employee Name</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Employee Code</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Status</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Masters Column</li>
</ul>

<p>5. In the Masters column, click <strong>approve. </strong> This
opens the CompOff Approval screen where you can select the date on
which the employee wants to take a compensatory off day.</p>

<p>6. In the CompOff Approval screen, the name of the employee, the
employee code, and the date of the holiday worked are displayed. You
can enter the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">CompOff Date: The regular working day
    when the employee wants to avail a holiday.</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Select the status of this leave request
    from the drop-down list. To approve the CompOff holiday, select
