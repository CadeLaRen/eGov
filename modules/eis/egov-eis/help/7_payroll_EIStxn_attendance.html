<h3>Mark Employee Attendance in Attendance Register</h3>

<p>Employee attendance is tracked in the Attendance Register.</p>

<p>To access the Attendance Register for an employee or a
department:</p>

<p>1. In the eGov EIS Payroll home page, click EIS-Payroll.</p>

<p>2. Click EIS.</p>

<p>3. Under EIS, click Attendance and then click Create.</p>

<p>4. In the Search Employee screen, specify the month for which you
want to view the attendance. </p>

<p>5. Select one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">To view and mark the attendance of a
    single employee, enter the employee code.</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">To view and mark the attendance of an
    entire department, click to select it from the drop-down list
    beside Department.</li>
</ul>

<p>6. Click <strong>Submit.</strong> The Attendance Register based on
the options you entered is displayed.</p>

<p><strong>Mark Attendance</strong></p>

<p>All authorised holidays in a month are shown in the Attendance
Register with the letter H.</p>

<p>In the Attendance Register for a given month, the following can be
entered:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Type P to mark the employee present on a
    given working day or holiday. If the employee is marked present
    on a holiday, and is eligible for compensatory off leave, a
    pop-up asking whether to grant a compensatory off holiday is
    displayed. </li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Type A to mark the employee absent on a
    given working day.</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Type HP to indicate the employee was
    present on half the day.</li>
</ul>

<p>After you have finished marking attendance, click
<strong>Save.</strong></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Notations L, NA, and C in the Attendance
Register are generated by the eGov application. A user cannot enter
them.</p>

<p>To indicate that an employee is on leave on a certain day, a leave
application needs to be created and approved. After this is done, the
letter L is displayed in the box corresponding to the date when the
employee was on leave. For further details, see <a
href="7_payroll_EIStxn_leaveapp_intro.html">Apply for Leave</a> and
<a name="Create" id="Create"
href="7_payroll_EIStxn_leaveapp_apply.html">Create Leave
Application.</a></p>

<p>When an employee works on a holiday and is awarded a compensatory
off day, the attendance register for that day displays the letter C.
See <a href="7_payroll_EIStxn_create_compoff.html">Compensatory
Off.</a></p>

<p>When an employee joins the organisation after the first of the
month, all the days before the joining date contain NA. This is
system generated. </p>
