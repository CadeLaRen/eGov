<h3>Cancel Leave Application</h3>

<p>A leave application can be cancelled when an employee does not
take leave on the dates mentioned in the leave application. For
example, when an employee has applied for 5 days leave but returns to
work after 3 days. </p>

<p>In this situation, the original leave application made for 5 days
needs to be cancelled and a new application for 3 days needs to be
created. Partial cancellation of a leave application is not
possible.</p>

<p>To cancel a leave application:</p>

<p>1. In the EIS menu, select Leave Application.</p>

<p>2. Click Cancel<strong>.</strong> This opens the Search Leave
Application to Cancel screen.</p>

<p>3. Enter the name, employee code, or other search criteria that
will help to locate the employee for whom it is necessary to cancel
the leave.</p>

<p>4. From the search results, identify the employee for whom you
want to cancel leave that has been applied for.</p>

<p>5. In the employee record, click the cancel link in the Masters
column. This displays the leave applications for the employee.</p>

<p>6. In the rightmost column of the row where the leave application
is to be cancelled, click on the link to open the Leave Application
screen. This shows all the details of the leave to be cancelled.</p>

<p>7. Click <strong>Cancel. </strong> A pop-up with the message,
<em>Do you want to cancel the leave? </em>is displayed.</p>

<p>8. You can now:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Click <strong>Cancel</strong> to retain
    leave application. 
    <p></p>
    <p>Or</p>
  </li>
  <li style="margin-left:0em">Click <strong>OK</strong> to cancel the
    leave. The confirmation message, <em>Leave application cancelled
    successfully</em> is displayed.<em></em></li>
</ul>

<p>After the leave application is cancelled, all the leave dates that
have been cancelled are now blank in the Attendance Register. The
dates that are blank should now be marked with the letter P. </p>

<p>After this is done, a fresh leave application for the actual leave
dates needs to be made. After this leave application is approved, the
Attendance Register will contain L for the relevant dates.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If an employee payslip has already been
generated taking into account the leave application that was later
cancelled, an arrear payslip needs to be generated in the Payroll
Module.</p>
