<h2>Employee Attendance</h2>

<p>Leave types and the number of days for each leave type are created
in the Leave Master. </p>

<p>Leave types are based on the designation of an employee.</p>

<p>Employee attendance is awarded and calculated based on the
calendar year. At the beginning of each calendar year, the leave that
an employee is eligible for is credited to his or her leave balance.
At the end of the calendar year, the leave closing balance is
calculated and those leave types that can be accumulated are carried
forward to the next financial year. </p>

<p>Employee attendance is tracked in the Attendance Register. The
