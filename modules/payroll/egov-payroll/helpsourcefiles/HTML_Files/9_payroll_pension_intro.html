<h1>Pension and End of Service Benefits</h1>

<p>When pension and gratuity are to be disbursed, the following cases need to
be taken into account:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Employee is alive and retires. The employee receives gratuity and
  pension.</li>
  <li>Employee dies before retirement and eligible nominees are present.
    Nominee(s) receive gratuity and pension.</li>
  <li>Employee dies after retirement and eligible nominees are present.
    Nominee(s) receive pension.</li>
</ul>

<p>To disburse pension and gratuity when an employee retires or dies before
retirement, the following need to be done:</p>

<p>1. <a href="#Update">Update employee status</a> in the Modify Employee
Details screen.</p>

<p>2. Create a Pension record.</p>

<p>3. Compute the total amount that needs to be disbursed. This is based on all
of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Pension</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Gratuity or commuted gratuity as applicable</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Unpaid Loan amounts</li>
</ul>

<p>4. Obtain approval from a superior in the ULB.</p>

<p>5. Record details for disbursal of pension.</p>

<p>6. Disburse pension to employee or eligible nominees.</p>

<p><strong>Employee Dies After Retirement</strong></p>

<p>When an employee dies after retirement and eligible nominees are present,
such nominees continue to receive the total pension amount in proportionate
shares. It must be remembered that the gratuity was paid at the time of
retirement. For this reason, steps to be followed are:</p>

<p>1. <a href="#Update">Update employee status</a> in the Modify Employee
Details screen.</p>

<p>2. Update Pension record to reflect nominees</p>

<p>3. Compute pension amounts to be disbursed to each of the eligible nominees.
(The total pension amount originally calculated is divided among the eligible
nominees.)</p>

<p>4. Obtain approval from a superior in the ULB.</p>

<p>5. Disburse pension to eligible nominees.</p>
