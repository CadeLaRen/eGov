<h2>About Recovery Payments</h2>

<p>When end of service benefits are calculated, they typically comprise
gratuity and one month's pension. In some cases other payments such as a
commuted pension are also paid. Before such payments are approved, outstanding
payments owed by the employee to the ULB need to be recovered. </p>

<p>To recover the amount from the end of service benefits(gratuity and
pension), an Inter-fund Unit Transfer (IUT) needs to be created. An IUT moves
the liabilities held by the employee in funds such as Festival Advance Fund to
the Pension Reserve Fund. The outstanding amount is recovered from the
employee's gratuity and pension. To effect this, two journal vouchers are
passed in eGov Financials.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: All gratuity and pension payments are made from
Pension Reserve Fund. Corresponding journal voucher entries should reflect
transactions from the Pension Reserve Fund.</p>

<p>The Record Recoveries screen records all the recovery payment details of the
employee. To create a recovery record of an employee:</p>

<p>1. Ensure the employee gratuity is computed. See <a
href="9_payroll_pension_gratuity_create.html">Create Gratuity Details</a>.</p>

<p>2. In the EIS-Payroll menu, click Payroll.</p>

<p>3. Click Pension and then click Recoveries.</p>

<p>4. Click Record Recoveries.</p>

<p>5. Type the Employee Code to search for the employee and click
<strong>Submit</strong>.</p>
