<h2>Managing Provident Fund (PF)</h2>

<p>Provident Fund is a fund to which both the employees and employer contribute
at the rate of 12% of the basic wages, dearness allowance and retaining
allowance, if any, payable to employees per month. It is returned to the
employee at the time of his/her retirement.</p>

<p>Employees' Provident Fund Scheme takes care of following needs of the
members:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Retirement</li>
  <li>Medical Care</li>
  <li>Family obligation</li>
  <li>Education of Children</li>
  <li>Financing of Insurance Polices</li>
</ul>

<p>Maintaining employee Provident Fund details is a statutory requirement. This
requires the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PF Liability Account--created and managed in the eGov Financials
  module</li>
  <li>PF Interest Expense Account-created and managed in the eGov Financials
    module</li>
</ul>

<p>Each month a Provident Fund deduction (PF Subscription) is made from the
employee's salary and credited to the PF Liability Account using a batch
process. </p>

<p>Interest is calculated on the amount in the PF Liability Account monthly or
annually depending on what is specified. When an annual interest rate is
specified, it is pro-rated for every month. Different interest rates can be
indicated across a year based on prevailing market conditions. Interest is
calculated on the last day of the month or the last day of the year based on
how the PF Liability Account is set up. </p>
