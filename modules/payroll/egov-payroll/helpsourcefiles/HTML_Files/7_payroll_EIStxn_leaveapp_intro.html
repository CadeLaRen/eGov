<h2>Leave Application</h2>

<p>It is a regular practice in all organizations that employees
should apply for leave in advance when possible. However, only
employees with the required authority can create their own leave
applications. Other employees need to inform their superiors of
proposed leave so that the corresponding leave application can be
created. </p>

<p>In eGov EIS Payroll, it is possible to create, view, and cancel an
employee leave application. Leave applications are automatically
approved when they are created. For this reason, no separate approval
of a leave application is required.</p>

<p>Leave applications can be cancelled and a fresh application made
in situations such as when an employee applies for 5 days leave but
actually takes only 3 days leave.</p>

<p>Information of approved leave days is used during payslip
generation. </p>

<p>There are two steps to create, view, or cancel a leave
application:</p>

<p>1. Search for the employee for whom the leave application needs to
be made, viewed, or canceled.</p>

<p>2. Do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Create a leave application by filling
    details in the Leave Application form</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">View a leave application</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Cancel a leave application</li>
</ul>
