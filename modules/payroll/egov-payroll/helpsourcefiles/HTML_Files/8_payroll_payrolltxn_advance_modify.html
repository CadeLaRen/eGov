<h3>Modifying a Salary Advance Record</h3>

<p>Occasionally, you may need to change the advance/loan details in situations
such as the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Employee wants to pay back the remaining amount in number of installments
    lesser than what specified earlier.</li>
  <li>Employee wants to pay back the remaining amount as a lump sum.</li>
  <li>Employee wants to increase the number of installments</li>
</ul>

<p>When an advance/loan is in the "created" state, you can modify the following
information: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Advance Amount</li>
  <li>Monthly amount to be paid</li>
  <li>Number of installments</li>
  <li>Payment method</li>
</ul>

<p>When an advance/loan is in the "approved" state, you can modify the
following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advance Amount</li>
  <li>Monthly amount to be paid</li>
  <li>Number of installments</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: After an advance/loan is disbursed, you can change
the monthly installment amount and the pending amount, which is generated
automatically by the system.</p>
