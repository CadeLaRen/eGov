<h2>Approve Gratuity and Pension</h2>

<p>After the gratuity and pension of an employee are calculated in
eGov Payroll, the following needs to be done:</p>

<p>1. The employee who created a set of gratuity and pension details
for a ULB employee who is no longer in service ( retired or deceased)
also needs to verify the details. The details for each retired
employee are listed as items in the employee's Inbox.</p>

<p>See <a href="9_payroll_pension_gratuity_modify.html">Verify
Gratuity and Pension</a> for the verification procedure.</p>

<p>2. Gratuity and pension details are sent to the employee's
superior in the ULB for approval only after the details are verified.
The employee's superior can then:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Sanction the total calculated amount.
    The amount is then ready for disbursal.</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Reject the total calculated amount. The
    details are then returned to the employee who created the
    gratuity and pension details. The employee needs to modify the
    necessary gratuity and pension details based on the superior's
    instructions and re-send the details for approval.</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="9_payroll_pension_gratuity_approve.html">Approve
Gratuity and Pension Disbursal Amount</a> for details.</p>
