<h1>Process Flow</h1>

<p>It is possible to maintain employee records, track employee attendance, and
generate employee payslips and reports with eGov Employee Information System
(EIS). All employee information is recorded in the EIS. This includes
information relevant to the employee such as personal details, bank details,
employment details, and so on. EIS maintains employee work history details for
the organization that include previous designations, departments, payscales,
and so on.</p>

<p>eGov EIS also serves as a means to record employee attendance. It is
possible to maintain complete employee attendance history, track the type of
leave applied or taken, dates and the number of leave days taken by the
employee. It is also possible to track holidays on which employees have worked
and enable them to avail of a holiday on a regular working day (CompOff). EIS
also accounts for encashment of leave at the end of every year for an employee.
All attendance information is sent to eGov Payroll System periodically.</p>

<p>Attendance information is used when employee payslips are generated. It is
possible to include earnings and deductions when calculating an employee's pay.
Salary Bills are created and after being approved by different approving
authorities such as Department, Accounts, and Audit, the Salary Bill is sent to
eGov Financials. Salary Bills can be viewed in eGov Financials alone. The
Journal Vouchers for the Salary Bills are generated in eGov Financials.</p>

<p>Payslips are generated by eGov Payroll System in batches or manually. The
process flow of eGov Payroll System when it is integrated with eGov EIS is
presented in the figure that follows.</p>
