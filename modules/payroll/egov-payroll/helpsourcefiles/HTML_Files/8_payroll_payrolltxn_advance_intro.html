<h2>Managing Salary Advances</h2>

<p>A salary advance is a payment issued to an employee in the form of a
short-term loan, for emergency situations, on a date in advance of the
employee&rsquo;s regularly scheduled payday. The amount of the advance is based
on a percentage of the net of forthcoming wages.</p>

<p>Advances are recovered in the form of monthly deductions from an employee's
salary. For the purpose of payroll deduction, advances are of two types:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Advances provided to employees by the ULB for a
    variety of personal reasons are deducted in monthly installments.</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Bank loans of an employee that the ULB undertakes
    to withhold and remit installments directly to the bank from the employee's
    salary.</li>
</ul>

<p>After an advance request is created it needs to be sanctioned by the
concerned officer. Only a ULB employee with the required privileges can
sanction an advance. For this reason, the item Sanction Advance appears as an
Inbox item for the employee's superior. After an advance is sanctioned, a
sanction number is assigned for the advance. The advance is now ready for
disbursal.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Only advances awarded by the ULB to an employee need
to be sanctioned. Advances that are Bank Loans are sanctioned as soon as the
advance is created.</p>
