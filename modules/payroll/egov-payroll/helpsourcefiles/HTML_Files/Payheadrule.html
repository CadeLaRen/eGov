<h2><a name="User-Defin" id="User-Defin">Managing User-Defined Payhead
Rules</a></h2>

<p>Occasionally, the standard calculation types such as Slab Based, Monthly
Flat Rate, and Computed Value may not suit your requirement of defining a
payhead. </p>

<p>For example, assume that you may want to define a payhead "DA" that needs to
be calculated as (10% of Basic + 5% of HRA), and another payhead "PF" as (12%
of Basic + 750). </p>

<p>In such cases, you can define a customized rule to compute payheads to suit
your business requirements.</p>
