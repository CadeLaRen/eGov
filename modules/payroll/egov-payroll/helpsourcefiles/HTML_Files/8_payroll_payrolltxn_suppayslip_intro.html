<h2>About Supplementary Payslips</h2>

<p>Supplementary payslips are payslips that are generated for an
employee in addition to the monthly payslip. Supplementary payslips
can be generated:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">To claim leave encashment. This is
    generated When employees are entitled to an encashment based on
    earned leave they did not avail.</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">To claim final settlement. This is
    generated when employees are entitled for settlement at the end
    of their employment tenure.</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">To claim arrears. This is generated when
    employees have arrears due to them.</li>
</ul>

<p>More than one supplementary payslip can be generated for an
employee per month. </p>

Payslip screen:</p>
