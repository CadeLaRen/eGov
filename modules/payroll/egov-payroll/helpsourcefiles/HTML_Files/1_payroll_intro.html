<h1>Introduction to Payroll</h1>

<p>EIS Payroll is a software package developed exclusively for urban local
bodies (ULBs). Establishment expenses constitute one of the largest expense
areas incurred by any government body. The government is also one of the
largest employers in the country.</p>

<p>The salient features of eGov EIS Payroll make it a productivity tool for
government bodies: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to define accounting heads for itemized earnings and
  deductions.</li>
  <li>Ability to define customized payhead rules to suit your business
    requirements.</li>
  <li>Salary computation with formulas for calculation of different accounting
    heads.</li>
  <li>Management of employee loans and salary advances.</li>
  <li>Payscale management: Payscales can be created, modified, and
  assigned.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Automatic Reports: 
    <ul>
      <li>MIS: Salary Summary </li>
      <li>Regulatory: PF Report, Gratuity Report </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Automatic integration with the Financial Accounting function available in
    eGov Financials. </li>
</ul>

<p>While eGov EIS Payroll maintains details of payscales and details of loans
and advances, it is necessary that there is integration with eGov Financials.
This is so that: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Summary salary bills created and approved in eGov EIS Payroll are sent to
    eGov Financials where a Journal Voucher for the same is passed. </li>
  <li>Payment Vouchers for advance disbursements and loan remittances are
    passed. </li>
  <li>Employee PF Balances are maintained. </li>
</ul>
