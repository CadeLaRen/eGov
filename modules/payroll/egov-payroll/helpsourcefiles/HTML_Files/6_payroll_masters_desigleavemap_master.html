<h3>Leave Master: Map Leave Type to Designation</h3>

<p>Not all designations within a ULB are eligible for the same types
of leave. In order to maintain the type of leave that a specific
designation can avail, it is possible to map leave types to a given
designation. To be able to map leave types:</p>

<p>1. From the Choose Designation drop-down list, click the
Designation for which you want to map leave types. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0em">This opens the Leave Master for the
designation. The Leave Master contains two columns. The left column
has the title Leave Type and the right column the title Number of
Days.</p>

<p>2. In the Leave Type column, click the downward arrow to select
the name of a leave type.</p>

<p>3. In the Number of Days column on the same row as the Leave Type
selected, type the number of days for that leave type.</p>

<p>4. You can continue to add more Leave Types and the corresponding
number of days. To add new rows, click <strong>Add Row</strong>.</p>

<p>5. To remove a row, place your cursor on the Leave Type or Number
of Days of that row and click <strong>Remove Row</strong>.</p>

<p>6. When you have completed entering details of all the leave types
for this designation, click <strong>Save.</strong></p>
