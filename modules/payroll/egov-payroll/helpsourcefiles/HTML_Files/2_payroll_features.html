<h1>General Software Features</h1>

<p>The key aspects of the eGov application are presented in this
chapter.</p>

<h2>Platform</h2>

<p>The eGov application is part of the Integrated Municipal
e-governance Application Suite developed by eGovernments Foundation.
Full integration of all the modules is depicted in the figure below .
All the modules are developed as web-based applications and can be
accessed over the Internet using a web-browser. This has the
following advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ease of Installation: Since the client machine needs to have
    only the ubiquitous web browser, no software installation is
    required on the client machines.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Multi-user, Integrated Database System: The architecture and
    application design is built ground up for usage by multiple users
    who might be located geographically in different offices. All the
    users in the system have the same view of the system in real
  time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Integration Platform: The eGov application is part of an
    Integrated Architecture that brings together all the departments
    within a ULB into a common information platform.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Proactive Information Disclosure: Availability of the data on
    an Internet platform allows for easy integration into a proactive
    information disclosure platform (for example, city websites),
    providing for an easy implementation of the Right To Information
    (RTI) Act.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>Navigation within all applications has been designed to be simple.
Various aspects of navigation are given in the following sections.</p>

<h3>Shortcut Keys</h3>

<p>A user can navigate around the Menu Tree by clicking the mouse.
The menu tree can be configured based on the employee designation and
only the relevant screens can be enabled for a user. When a user is
in a screen, mouse clicks or the tab button can be used to move from
one field to another. The special keys in the table have been
designed for ease of data entry.</p>

<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr style="text-align:center;">
      <td><p><strong>Keystroke </strong></p>
      </td>
      <td><p><strong>Action </strong></p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><p>Alt+X</p>
      </td>
      <td><p>Close a window</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><p>Alt+S</p>
      </td>
      <td><p>Save and close the window</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><p>Alt+N</p>
      </td>
      <td><p>Save and open a new window</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><p>Alt+C</p>
      </td>
      <td><p>Cancel</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><p>Alt+G*</p>
      </td>
      <td><p>To show the GL Entry </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><p>Alt+A* </p>
      </td>
      <td><p>Add a record</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><p>Alt+M*</p>
      </td>
      <td><p>Modify a record</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><p>F2*</p>
      </td>
      <td><p>Add a new row for debit/credit transaction in any of the
        transaction grids</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>*Applicable in some eGov products</p>

<h3>Working on Multiple Windows</h3>

<p>The application works in a web-browser window (Internet Explorer)
and allows the user to open multiple windows at a time. From the main
menu screen, the user can open a new window using the Ctrl+N key
(alternatively: File -&gt; New -&gt; Window). This helps the user to
access information from other screens or modules while working on a
particular screen or module.</p>

<h3>Selection from Drop-down Lists </h3>

<p>The application provides drop-down lists wherever possible,
allowing the user to select from the lists. For example, in the View
Advance screen, when you type the employee code a list of employee
codes is displayed. When a given employee code is selected, the
Employee Name field displays the name of the employee.</p>

<p>Drop-down lists are of three types:</p>

<table border="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Drop-down icon"
        src="images/icon dropdown2.png" width="130" height="22"
      /></td>
      <td><p>Click on the arrow mark to display the options
        available. This is used when the list of drop-down options is
        not very long.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:right;"><p
        style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Drop-down icon"
        src="images/icon dropdown.png" width="130" height="21" /></p>
      </td>
      <td><p>Click<img alt="Drop-down icon"
        src="images/icon dropdown3.png" width="21" height="20" /> to
        search for relevant values. This is used when the list of
        drop-down options is long. Data can be filtered based on the
        value entered in the text box.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:right;"><p style="text-align:right;"><img
        alt="Drop-down icon" src="images/icon dropdown4.png"
        width="130" height="20" /></p>
      </td>
      <td>Type the value in the field. When you start to enter the
        number, it displays the values that begin with the number you
        typed. Click to select the record from the list.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Search </h3>

<p>Search screens can be used to quickly locate relevant records for
a user and is used in eGov applications extensively. Search screens
are designed based on the application and the relevant feature.</p>

<p>For example, eGovFinancials uses the following Search screen:</p>

<p><img alt="Search screen" src="images/search screen 2.png"
style="display: block; text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"
width="377" height="74" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>eGov Financials Search
Screen</strong></p>

<p>1. Enter the search criteria based on the description given in the
table.</p>

<table border="1" style="width:70%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Option</strong> </td>
      <td><strong>Field Value</strong> </td>
      <td><strong>Field Description</strong> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sort Order </td>
      <td>Code </td>
      <td>Sorts in the increasing order of Code. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span style="color:#ffffff">Sort Order</span></td>
      <td>Description</td>
      <td>Sorts Descriptions alphabetically. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Filter</td>
      <td>Left</td>
      <td>Searches for the keyword at the beginning of a Description.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span style="color:#ffffff">Filter</span></td>
      <td>Within </td>
      <td>Searches for the keyword within a Description. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span style="color:#ffffff">Filter</span></td>
      <td>Right</td>
      <td>Searches for the keyword at the end of a Description.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Description </td>
      <td><span style="color:#ffffff">Type search details</span></td>
      <td>Searches for a record with the keyword or the text that is
        entered. </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>2. Click <strong>Filter</strong> to display the search results.
</p>

<p>3. Click on the record to display it on the transaction screen.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Account Code field in specific
transaction screens displays the account codes that are relevant for
that screen. This feature provides information on a need-basis, and
reduces the chances of mistakes by the user. This is set up using the
Code-Screen Mapping feature.</p>

<p>In eGov EIS Payroll, the following Search screen is used for the
Search Employee screen to view the employee details:</p>

<p><img alt="Search Employee" src="images/search screen chapter2.png"
width="708" height="130" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>eGov EIS Payroll Search
Screen-Search Employee</strong></p>

<p>1. When you start to enter the Employee Code, a list of all
employees with employee codes that begin with the number you typed is
displayed. </p>

<p>2. Click to select the employee from the list. The Employee Name
is automatically filled.</p>

<h3>Screen Help</h3>

<p>All transaction screens are provided with an icon with a question
mark on the top-right corner (see below) that takes the user to the
screen level help.</p>

<p><img alt="Help  icon" src="images/icon help.png"
style="display: block; text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"
width="101" height="88" />When the help button is clicked, the help
window pops up. This provides you with an overview of the screen as
well as help with all the fields on the screen.</p>

<h3>Voucher Numbering</h3>

<p>Voucher numbers need to be manually entered for each voucher.
Manual voucher numbers are entered based on the following rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first letter identifies the Fund to which the Voucher
    belongs. This identifier is assigned to the Fund as part of
  Setup.</li>
  <li>The second letter identifies the type of voucher. The options
    are: Receipts, Payments, Contras, and Journal Vouchers.</li>
  <li>This is followed by a number (up to 10-digits).</li>
</ul>

<p>The eGov application also generates a Computer Generated (CG)
number internally for each voucher. The CG number can be used by
users to retrieve specific vouchers at any point in time.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The voucher numbering remains unique since
it is based on the financial year and the voucher type. The CG number
is re-set to 00001 at the beginning of each financial year.</p>

<p>On successful completion of a transaction, the following message
is displayed: <em>Transaction Successfully executed</em>. It also
displays the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Voucher number entered by the user</li>
  <li>CG number generated by the system</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: In case of a system error, it is strongly
recommended to record the error message and report it to the support
desk. The support desk will help resolve the problem.</p>

<h3>Built-in Calendar </h3>

<p>eGov applications use a built-in calendar to validate the voucher
date for each transaction. For example, the following conditions are
checked in the Create Employee screen for eGov EIS Payroll:</p>

<p>1. The <strong>Date of first Appointment</strong> of an employee
should be before the <strong>From Date</strong> in the Assignment
Details section.</p>

<p>2. In the Assignment Details section the <strong>To Date</strong>
of one assignment should be prior to the <strong>From Date</strong>
of the next assignment.</p>

<p>3. The employee's age is validated so that the minimum age of the
employee is 15 years.</p>
