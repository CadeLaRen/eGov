<h2>Advance Disbursement</h2>

<p>Sanctioned advances can be disbursed to the employee by cheque,
cash, or in the form of a direct bank transfer. Disbursement is for
the entire advance amount, and no partial payments will be made.</p>

<p>When an advance is disbursed, the monthly payment towards the
advance amount is recovered as a deduction in subsequent employee
payslips.</p>

<h3>Disbursement by Cheque</h3>

<p>When an advance is disbursed by cheque, a cheque needs to be
generated for every employee. You can create, view, or modify cheque
disbursement details. </p>

<p>To manage cheque disbursement details: </p>

<p>1. In the Payroll menu, select Advance Disbursement. </p>

<p>2. Click By Cheque, then click one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;"><strong>Create</strong> to create
    details for disbursement by cheque</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;"><strong>View</strong> to view cheque
    disbursement details </li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;"><strong>Modify</strong> to modify cheque
    disbursement details </li>
</ul>

<p>3. In the Employee Code drop-down list, click on the Employee
Code. All the employees that have sanctioned advances with the
disbursement type as cheque are displayed. </p>

<p>4. Click <strong>Submit</strong>.</p>

<h3>Disbursement by Cash or Direct Bank Transfer</h3>

<p>When advance disbursement is done by cash or by direct bank
transfer, a single disbursement voucher is created for all the
employees with a common Advance Type and Fund. For example, if a
sanctioned advance exists for ten employees that are assigned Adhoc
Advances (Advance Type) from the General Fund (name of the Fund),
only one voucher is created in eGov EIS Payroll. This voucher
contains details of the total advance amount that needs to be given
to these ten employees. </p>

<p>After the voucher is passed, the total amount is finally disbursed
among the employees by cash or by bank transfer.</p>

<p>To create disbursement details for cash or for direct bank
transfers, do the following:</p>

<p>1. Search for the advance disbursement based on the:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Advance Type</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Name of the Fund</li>
