<h2>Approving an Employee Payslip</h2>

<p>After employee payslips are generated (manually or by batch generation), the
payslips have to be approved by the concerned officer. Only a ULB employee with
the required privileges can approve a payslip. He/She can access the payslips
pending for approval from his/her inbox. </p>

<p>In the Payslip Approval screen, payslips that are pending approval are
grouped based on the employee department and the month in which the payslip was
generated. Each grouped set of payslips is displayed with a task. A task
indicates the number of payslips that are pending approval for each set of
payslips. </p>

<p>To approve a payslips, perform the following steps:</p>

<p>1. In the Payroll menu, select Payslip.</p>

<p>2. Click Approve to open the Payslip Approval screen.</p>

<p>Only payslips that are assigned to the employee are displayed here.</p>

<p></p>

<p>3. Click the name of the payslip under the Task folder. This displays the
payslip with details such as the employee's Name, Designation, Fund, Function,
Net pay, and so on. </p>

<p>The payslip details can be modified as required and saved. See <a
href="ModifyPayslip.html#Modifying">Modifying an employee payslip</a>.</p>

<p>4. Click the View link to view the employee payslip. </p>

<p>5. In the observation field, type any comments such as the reason the
payslip is rejected or approved, any modifications made to the payslip, and so
on. </p>

<p>6. You can do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Click to select the Accept check box to approve
    the displayed payslip</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Click to select the Reject check box to reject the
    approval request for the payslip.</li>
</ul>

<p>7. Click <strong>Submit</strong>. The following message is displayed:
<em>Executed Successfully</em>.</p>
