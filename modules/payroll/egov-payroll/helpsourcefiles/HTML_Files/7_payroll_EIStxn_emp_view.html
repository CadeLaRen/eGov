<h3>View Employee Details</h3>

for the employee record based on any of the criteria given below:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Designation: Click the designation of
    the employee from the drop-down list.</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Department: Click the department of the
    employee from the drop-down list. </li>

    if known. 
    <p><strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When a search is based on the Employee
    Code, the search is done on all active and inactive employee
    records. In such a case, the Search All option is invalid. </p>
  </li>

    if known.</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;"> style="margin-left:0;"Search All

    appropriate option: 
    <ul>
      <li style="margin-left:0em"><strong>Yes</strong> to search for
        all employees (both past and present). It is not advisable to
        select this option as it could result in a large number of
        recrods being retrieved which could make the application very
        slow. </li>
      <li style="margin-left:0em"><strong>No</strong> to search for
        only active employees.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
