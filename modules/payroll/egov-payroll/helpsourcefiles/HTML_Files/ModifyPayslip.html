<h2>About Deduction Reference Number</h2>

<p>Every month, employees make payments to external agencies such as LIC,
Income Tax Department, and Banks for various services. Such employees may opt
to make remittance to these agencies through deductions from salary every
month. One employee may be associated with multiple deductions such as
professional tax, LIC or insurance premiums, home loan, personal loan. To track
these deductions and reflect them in the payslips, you can add a reference
number to each of the deductions while modifying payslips.</p>
