<h3>Sanctioning a Salary Advance</h3>

<p>After an advance request is created it needs to be sanctioned by the
concerned officer. Only a ULB employee with the required privileges can
sanction an advance. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Only advances awarded by the ULB to an employee need
to be sanctioned. Advances that are Bank Loans are sanctioned as soon as the
advance is created.</p>

<p>To sanction the salary advance awarded to an employee, perform the following
steps:</p>

<p>1. In the <strong>Payroll</strong> menu, click <strong>Advance</strong>.</p>

<p>2. Click <strong>Sanction</strong> to open the Salary Advance Sanction
screen where you can search for the employee whose advance you wish to
sanction.</p>

<p>3. Type the employee code in the <strong>Employee Code</strong> field.</p>

<p>4. Type the employee name in the <strong>Employee Name</strong> field.</p>

<p>5. Click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>

<p>The list of advances that have not been sanctioned for the employee are
displayed.</p>

<p>5. In the Advance column, click on the name of the advance that needs to be
sanctioned. This opens the Sanction Advance screen that contains all details of
the advance.</p>
