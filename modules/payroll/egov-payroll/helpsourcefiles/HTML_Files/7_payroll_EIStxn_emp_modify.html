  </li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Search All (Active and Inactive): Click
    the radio button beside the appropriate option: 
    <ul>
      <li style="margin-left:0em"><strong>Yes</strong> to search for
        all employees (both past and present). It is not advisable to
        select this option as it could result in a large number of
        recrods being retrieved which could make the application very
        slow. </li>
      <li style="margin-left:0em"><strong>No</strong> to search for
        only active employees.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>4. Click <strong>Submit</strong> to search for the employee
record. Employees that satisfy the search criteria are displayed.</p>

<p>5. Click <strong>Modify</strong> in the row that has the employee
name whose account you wish to modify. The Employee Details screen of

<p>To assign a new payscale or another designation to the
employee:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0;">Click <strong>Add Row</strong> in the
    Payscale Details section and enter the new payscale details. See
    <a href="7_payroll_EIStxn_emp_create.html">Create Employee</a>
