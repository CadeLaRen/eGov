<h1>System Overview</h1>

<p>This chapter describes how to access eGov applications and view the
different menu options. The menu options that are displayed depend on the role
that has been assigned to the user. </p>

<h2>User Roles</h2>

<p>A user role is assigned to each employee of a ULB, when an employee record
is created. What is important to note is that a user role for the purpose of
working with eGov applications is different from the employee designation
within the ULB. To illustrate, an employee with a designation of Senior
Accountant could have a user role Super User. With this user role, the employee
would have wide access to all the features of the application.</p>

<h2>Logging on to the Application</h2>

<p>eGov applications are web-based and can be accessed from a Web browser. The
system can be accessed either by typing the URL of application in the Address
bar or by accessing the site from the city Web site. When you type the URL in
the Address bar, the login page is displayed. </p>

<p><img alt="Login screen" src="images/login page.png"
style="display: block; text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"
width="321" height="290" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Login Screen</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>Each user is provided a unique UserName and Password.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span
style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif">1. In the
<strong>UserName</strong> field, type your UserName.</span></span></p>

<p>2. In the <strong>Password</strong> field, type your password.</p>

<p>3. Click <strong>Login.</strong></p>

<p>The system then validates these details. When a valid UserName and Password
combination is entered, the application home page is displayed.</p>

<p>The home page is divided into the following parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Header Section</strong> which shows the following: 
    <ul>
      <li style="margin-left:2em;">Name of the ULB</li>
      <li style="margin-left:2em;">eGovernments logo. If a user clicks on this
        when in any other screen, they return to the home page.</li>
      <li style="margin-left:2em;">Logout link. Click this when you have
        finished your work and wish to exit from the system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Menu Tree Section:</strong> This lists the menu in a tree form.
    The actual contents of the tree are populated based on the role assigned to
    a particular user. eGov applications are fully menu-driven with a
    multi-level menu structure which allows a user to select an option in the
    menu and go to the next lower level with each selection.</li>
</ul>
