<h2>About Employee Payslip Approval</h2>

<p>After employee payslips are generated (manually or by batch generation), the
payslips have to be approved. Only a ULB employee with the required privileges
can approve a payslip. This would typically be the employee's superior. For
this reason, the Approve Payslips appears as an Inbox item for the employee's
superior. Typically, eGov EIS Payroll has three levels of approval for an
employee payslip. </p>
