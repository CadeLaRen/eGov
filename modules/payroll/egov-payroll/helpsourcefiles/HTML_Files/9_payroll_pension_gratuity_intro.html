<h2>About Gratuity </h2>

<p>In a ULB, employees are eligible to receive a gratuity when they retire. The
same gratuity amount is given to the employee's nominee if the employee dies
before retirement. </p>

<p>The total payment that needs to be paid at the end of an employee's tenure
(when the employee retires or is deceased) is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Gratuity + one month's pension </p>

<p><strong>Calculations for Computing Gratuity and Monthly Pension</strong></p>

<p>Gratuity is calculated as the lower of:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0em">Gratuity factor x Basic in employee's current
    salary 
    <p>and</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-left:0em">Gratuity limit specified for the ULB</li>
</ul>

<p>Pension that needs to be disbursed each month is calculated as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Employee's current Basic + Employee's current DA
</p>

<p><strong>Commute Pension</strong></p>

<p>Employees have an option to commute their pension (withdraw a part of their
pension as a lump sum) at the time of retirement. When a pension is commuted,
the employee can specify the new and reduced pension amount that they are
willing to receive after withdrawing the lump sum.</p>

<p>The withdrawal amount, or the commute pension amount is calculated as:</p>

<p>Basic x Commute percentage x Commute period x 12</p>

<p>where,</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em">Basic is the basic component in the employee's
latest payslip.</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em">Commute percentage is the percentage of the pension
that needs to be commuted. </p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Commute period is the number of years for which an
amount is deducted from the pension. Multiply the value by 12 (months) since
the commute period is in years. </p>

<p>For an employee who has availed the commute pension option:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">The total payment that needs to be made at the end
of the employee's tenure is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:4em">Gratuity + Commuted pension</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">The monthly pension that is payable to the employee
is calculated as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">(Employee's current Basic + Employee's current DA)
- (Basic x Commute percentage) </p>

<p>Suppose an employee whose Basic is Rs. 10,000 wants to commute 20% of his
pension amount. If the ULB he works for defines the commute period as 10 years,
the commute pension is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>10000 (Basic) x 20/100 (Commute percentage) x 10 (Commute period) x 12 =
240000</p>

<p>Hence Rs. 2,40,000 is the commuted pension amount.</p>

<p>If the employee's current DA is Rs.2500, the monthly pension payable to the
employee for the next ten years is: </p>

<p>10000 (Basic) + 2500 (DA) - [10000 (Basic) x 20/100 (Commute percentage)] =
Rs. 10500</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When the commute percentage is typed, all the
gratuity calculations are done automatically in eGov EIS Payroll.</p>
