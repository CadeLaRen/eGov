<h3>Resolve an Unprocessed Payslip</h3>

<p>A list of unprocessed payslips is displayed with the employee
name, employee code, department name, payslip date, and the reason
the payslip remains unprocessed.</p>

<p>Based on the reason in the Remarks column, you need to do the
following:</p>

<table border="1" style="width: 70%">

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Reason in the Remarks column</strong></td>

      <td><strong>To Resolve Error</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Previous payslip does not exist</td>
      <td>This is displayed when no approved payslip exists for the
        previous month. Typical for a new employee.</td>
      <td>Create a new employee payslip.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Negative total</td>
      <td>This is displayed when the deductions of the employee
        exceed the earnings.</td>
      <td>Remove deductions that need to be paid this month and
        divide it across other months.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>End of his tenure</td>
      <td>This is displayed if the employee retires in the current

        employee based on the attendance.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Exception created</td>
      <td>This is displayed when the employee is marked for an
        exception payslip. See <a
        href="8_payroll_payrolltxn_payscexcptn_intro.html#Payroll">Payroll
        Exception</a> for details.</td>
      <td>Generate (or do not generate) employee payslip based on the
        exception. For example, if the employee is retiring from the
        organization, and a payroll exception has been created, the
        payslip needs to be generated manually.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Payslip already exists</td>
      <td>This is displayed when the employee payslip has already
        been generated.</td>
      <td>Check the reason for the duplicate payslip.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Basic exceeds his limit</td>
      <td>This is displayed when the basic salary component exceeds
        the assigned payscale limit when an increment is added.</td>
      <td>You can do one of the following: 

        <p>1. Change the payscale assigned to the employee.</p>

        <p>2. Decrease the increment value.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The payslips needs to be processed manually based on the reason
for payslip failure. If there are no previously approved payslips,
all details in the payslip have to be manually entered.</p>

payslip you need to process. The Generate Payslip screen is displayed

</ul>

<p>3. If the Payroll Master has been recently updated click
<strong>Recompute Deductions</strong> to recalculate the payhead
