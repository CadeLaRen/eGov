<h2>Managing Employee Payslips</h2>

<p>Employee payslips are processed manually or generated in batches and sent
for approval. An employee payslip details all the payment components remitted
to an employee. It includes all the earnings and deductions of an employee for
a specific time-period.</p>

<p>The Basic, Earnings such as DA, HRA, CCA, travel allowance, medical
allowance, pension allowance, commission, increment, and Deductions such as
income tax, professional tax, advance, and Other Deductions such as Municipal
Union Fund are all considered during payslip generation.</p>

<p>The Payscale Master: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Specifies the relevant linked payheads for each employee.</li>
  <li>Adds Payhead-Earnings to an employee payslip only when specified. </li>
  <li>Calculates the Payhead-Earning based on the Calculation Type, Percentage
    values and Attendance.</li>
</ul>

<p>See table to know how Payhead-Earnings are calculated for each calculation
type: </p>

<p>Based on the Payhead Deduction, the following is done: </p>
<ul>
  <li>For Deduction-Bank Loan: The monthly deduction for the bank loan is
    deducted from the payslip.</li>
  <li>For Deduction-Advances : The monthly advance deduction amount is deducted
    from the payslip.</li>
  <li>For Deduction-Tax and Deduction-Other: When the deduction is mapped to: 
    <ul>
      <li>An automatic recovery account, the slab details in eGov Financials
        provide the deduction amount. <strong></strong> 
        <p><strong>NOTE</strong><strong>:</strong> An automatic recovery
        account has a fixed deduction amount or percentage.</p>
      </li>
      <li>A manual recovery account or not mapped to any account, the deduction
        amount is the same as that of the previous month. 
        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: For a manual recovery account, the deduction
        needs to be calculated manually every time. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Increments: Based on the increments defined in the Payscale Master, an
    increment is added to the Basic, if applicable.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the payslips are processed, any errors encountered during generation
of batch payslips will be sent as an unprocessed payslip with the reason for
failure.</p>
